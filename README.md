### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes, readme is displayed first, title and author name and contact information are provided.

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)-Yes, readme is displayed first and the tile and author names/contact are provided

#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear from the Introduction?  What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes, the program aims to use an algorithum to calculate the curvature of microridges on imaged skin cells.

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)-Yes, the program aims to take data from TR8 and reorganize it so a researcher is able to locate data about a specific plant species particularly DNA.


#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes, the program contains three main scrips and one wrapper script to run them all. The scripts match points along the ridges and uses these to calculate acceleration and slope which are used to calculate curvature. The ouput results in a csv file with the calculated curvature for each image.

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)- Yes, program reads an input file and deliminates by removing semicolons and blanks replacing those with tabs, all information other than genus and species is deleted as are duplicates, new information and specific information pertaining to the user are organized in a table

#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes, and they indicated including the Hoffman

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)-Yes, and the dependences are indicated including the Hoffman (R also here)
#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?

MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- The instructions make sense are are well put, I do not have issues with the instructions the only improvement would be maybe a chronological list instead of paragraph form but in all honestly that isn't an issue.

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)- Yes, the instructions are chronological and I was able to follow them. I would just put a tab on the bullet parts of the instructions to help with visual organization.

#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)-Yes
#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited? 
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- All  are cited and provided
PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)- Yes all are cited and provided

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)- Yes
#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
XXXXX

### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes test set and commands to run the program are included

PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)- Yes these are included, they are in markdown files however

#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- I was able to run the program. It was difficult to get the images on to my hoffman due to my own organization. 
PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)-Yes, I was able to get everything running I didn't have any issues with it.
#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
---
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- Yes
PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)- Yes

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
MCA (Microridege Curviness Analysis)- This is solid, the only suggestions would be to remove unneaded folders and files but the author has not fully completed the project so it is likely that action will occur. Overall good job.


PITA (Plants in Trait Analysis)-I would change the formating at the beginning so that the authors and their contact info are not in paragraph form but in a list form for readability. Instructions could use some more clarity but overall good job.
